post hoc power analysis

for aldex - can do per gene basis
adding in something elese doesn't change results of remainder

you take your existing experiment

add in dummy gene make it 1x and 1.5x in your two conditions - see if it comes up as significant
can change it to see at what fold difference you can detect
and what abundance you need

set up 10 mock genes that had base count between 1 and 100 (use powers of two)
looked at fold changes 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

perform random sample from dirichlet
(so when it's 1X, it's 1Xdirichlet sampling)

perform aldex to randomly sampled input

* no biological variation, only technical variation

*CAN BE DONE WITH ENTIRELY FAKE DATA - can use power law or they can be uniform or whatever
can model your experiment so that if you have 10,000 reads, whats your power, whatabout with 100,000 or 1,000,000 reads?

mirror the differential abundances so that sums are the same in both onditions
